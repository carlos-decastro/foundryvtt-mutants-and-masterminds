# Unofficial Mutants and Masterminds 3rd Edition for FoundryVTT
The *unofficial* system for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com) 0.7.9. This project is currently
*work in progress* and many things are subject to change.

## Install
Currently it is not ready for installation. Please check back later.

## System Goals
### Ease of Use
The main goal of this system is to make it easy to build powers and effects via dragging and dropping. Each effect defines set of parameters that determines if a roll is needed, what to do in
an attack, and the total DC of the resistance check if necessary. Modifiers can be dragged and 
onto effects to override these parameters and the effect itself can be dropped into a power.
